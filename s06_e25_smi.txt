<sync start=3938>
<p class=KRCC>What? What did you..? What?
<sync start=6236>&nbsp;
<sync start=8242>
<p class=KRCC>I still love you.
<sync start=9937>&nbsp;
<sync start=10144>
<p class=KRCC>I know I shouldn't even be here telling you this.
<sync start=13602>&nbsp;
<sync start=13814>
<p class=KRCC>You're with Chandler, who I like.
<sync start=16214>&nbsp;
<sync start=16417>
<p class=KRCC>If you say he's straight, I'll believe you.
<sync start=19147>&nbsp;
<sync start=20154>
<p class=KRCC>After seeing you, I knew if I didn't tell you I'd regret it.
<sync start=24386>&nbsp;
<sync start=24592>
<p class=KRCC>Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
<sync start=28119>&nbsp;
<sync start=28729>
<p class=KRCC>You're really not supposed to be back here.
<sync start=31755>&nbsp;
<sync start=32033>
<p class=KRCC>I'm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place...
<sync start=36663>&nbsp;
<sync start=36871>
<p class=KRCC>but I had to tell you.
<sync start=38896>&nbsp;
<sync start=39240>
<p class=KRCC>I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you.
<sync start=42767>&nbsp;
<sync start=43811>
<p class=KRCC>I wanna have kids with you.
<sync start=46041>&nbsp;
<sync start=48482>
<p class=KRCC>Oh, my God. Why don't they put chairs back here?
<sync start=51918>&nbsp;
<sync start=53087>
<p class=KRCC>Look, I know this is crazy, but am I too late?
<sync start=56545>&nbsp;
<sync start=56958>
<p class=KRCC>You're too late. Where was all this three years ago?
<sync start=60553>&nbsp;
<sync start=60728>
<p class=KRCC>I know. I was an idiot.
<sync start=63162>&nbsp;
<sync start=63364>
<p class=KRCC>I tried to forget you. I really did.
<sync start=65832>&nbsp;
<sync start=66033>
<p class=KRCC>After our last lunch, I spent six months in Africa trying to forget.
<sync start=70732>&nbsp;
<sync start=71138>
<p class=KRCC>-What did you do there? 
<sync start=74403>&nbsp;
<sync start=71138>
<p class=KRCC>Work with blind kids.
<sync start=74403>&nbsp;
<sync start=74608>
<p class=KRCC>What are you doing to me?
<sync start=77099>&nbsp;
<sync start=77611>
<p class=KRCC>Look, I...
<sync start=79135>&nbsp;
<sync start=79480>
<p class=KRCC>I'm sorry, but this is not gonna happen.
<sync start=82608>&nbsp;
<sync start=83317>
<p class=KRCC>That's fine. I'll walk away. I'll never bother you again.
<sync start=87219>&nbsp;
<sync start=87421>
<p class=KRCC>Only if you say Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
<sync start=91824>&nbsp;
<sync start=92025>
<p class=KRCC>Well, he is. I mean...
<sync start=94425>&nbsp;
<sync start=94661>
<p class=KRCC>marriage is all he talks about. My goodness!
<sync start=98153>&nbsp;
<sync start=98365>
<p class=KRCC>In fact, I'm the one making him wait.
<sync start=101198>&nbsp;
<sync start=101468>
<p class=KRCC>You are? Why?
<sync start=103197>&nbsp;
<sync start=103403>
<p class=KRCC>Why?
<sync start=104802>&nbsp;
<sync start=105772>
<p class=KRCC>Because of the government.
<sync start=107740>&nbsp;
<sync start=148645>
<p class=KRCC>Isn't it incredible?
<sync start=151170>&nbsp;
<sync start=151381>
<p class=KRCC>Monica and Chandler are getting married.
<sync start=154407>&nbsp;
<sync start=154618>
<p class=KRCC>I know. They'll be so happy together.
<sync start=157610>&nbsp;
<sync start=157888>
<p class=KRCC>How often do two best friends fall in love?
<sync start=160789>&nbsp;
<sync start=160991>
<p class=KRCC>-Not that often. 
<sync start=163050>&nbsp;
<sync start=160991>
<p class=KRCC>No.
<sync start=163050>&nbsp;
<sync start=163927>
<p class=KRCC>-I'm so happy for them. 
<sync start=168193>&nbsp;
<sync start=163927>
<p class=KRCC>Me too. So happy for them.
<sync start=168193>&nbsp;
<sync start=168798>
<p class=KRCC>I'm so happy and not at all jealous.
<sync start=171289>&nbsp;
<sync start=171835>
<p class=KRCC>Oh, no! God, definitely not jealous.
<sync start=175566>&nbsp;
<sync start=180310>
<p class=KRCC>I'm probably 98% happy and maybe 2% jealous.
<sync start=184508>&nbsp;
<sync start=184714>
<p class=KRCC>-I mean, what's 2%? That's nothing. 
<sync start=187979>&nbsp;
<sync start=184714>
<p class=KRCC>Totally.
<sync start=187979>&nbsp;
<sync start=190687>
<p class=KRCC>-I'm like 90/10. 
<sync start=193121>&nbsp;
<sync start=190687>
<p class=KRCC>Yeah. Me too.
<sync start=193121>&nbsp;
<sync start=198497>
<p class=KRCC>Have you guys seen Chandler?
<sync start=200624>&nbsp;
<sync start=203468>
<p class=KRCC>No. But you know who was looking for you?
<sync start=206369>&nbsp;
<sync start=206572>
<p class=KRCC>Tennille.
<sync start=208199>&nbsp;
<sync start=216848>
<p class=KRCC>The marriage stuff you were saying yesterday? You don't believe that.
<sync start=221342>&nbsp;
<sync start=221520>
<p class=KRCC>Sure, I do. In fact, I think the concept of marriage is unnatural.
<sync start=226856>&nbsp;
<sync start=227059>
<p class=KRCC>Look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs.
<sync start=231120>&nbsp;
<sync start=231330>
<p class=KRCC>Pigs don't mate for life.
<sync start=233127>&nbsp;
<sync start=233332>
<p class=KRCC>A pig can have 100 sexual partners in a lifetime.
<sync start=236961>&nbsp;
<sync start=237169>
<p class=KRCC>That's an ordinary pig, not even a pig that's good at sports.
<sync start=241000>&nbsp;
<sync start=243422>
<p class=KRCC>Are you telling me you may never want to get married?
<sync start=247188>&nbsp;
<sync start=247596>
<p class=KRCC>Never say never, but, probably...
<sync start=250224>&nbsp;
<sync start=250432>
<p class=KRCC>yeah, never.
<sync start=251729>&nbsp;
<sync start=252868>
<p class=KRCC>Oh, my God. Then what are we even doing? What is this?
<sync start=257066>&nbsp;
<sync start=257272>
<p class=KRCC>Whoa, whoa, whoa! What is all this pressure?
<sync start=260708>&nbsp;
<sync start=261176>
<p class=KRCC>Is this some new strategy?
<sync start=263076>&nbsp;
<sync start=263278>
<p class=KRCC>Why don't you put down your copy of The Rules, huh, mantrap?
<sync start=267476>&nbsp;
<sync start=268484>
<p class=KRCC>You know what? I gotta go.
<sync start=270509>&nbsp;
<sync start=272788>
<p class=KRCC>It's okay. I got a plan.
<sync start=275279>&nbsp;
<sync start=280963>
<p class=KRCC>-We're gonna find love. 
<sync start=283591>&nbsp;
<sync start=280963>
<p class=KRCC>Definitely.
<sync start=283591>&nbsp;
<sync start=285100>
<p class=KRCC>Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that.
<sync start=287762>&nbsp;
<sync start=288203>
<p class=KRCC>That's what makes it so easy to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler.
<sync start=292799>&nbsp;
<sync start=293709>
<p class=KRCC>-A guarantee would be nice. 
<sync start=296735>&nbsp;
<sync start=293709>
<p class=KRCC>What do you mean?
<sync start=296735>&nbsp;
<sync start=296912>
<p class=KRCC>Some friends make a deal.
<sync start=299403>&nbsp;
<sync start=299615>
<p class=KRCC>Like if neither of them are married by 40, they marry each other.
<sync start=304143>&nbsp;
<sync start=304353>
<p class=KRCC>-A backup? 
<sync start=306048>&nbsp;
<sync start=304353>
<p class=KRCC>Exactly.
<sync start=306048>&nbsp;
<sync start=306255>
<p class=KRCC>Yeah, I've got that.
<sync start=307984>&nbsp;
<sync start=309491>
<p class=KRCC>You do?
<sync start=310958>&nbsp;
<sync start=311160>
<p class=KRCC>-Who? 
<sync start=312457>&nbsp;
<sync start=311160>
<p class=KRCC>Joey.
<sync start=312457>&nbsp;
<sync start=312628>
<p class=KRCC>-Joey? Are you serious? 
<sync start=317463>&nbsp;
<sync start=312628>
<p class=KRCC>I locked him in years ago.
<sync start=317463>&nbsp;
<sync start=320703>
<p class=KRCC>Wait. So if neither of you are married by 40, you'll marry Joey?
<sync start=325731>&nbsp;
<sync start=325941>
<p class=KRCC>Yep. We shook on it.
<sync start=327875>&nbsp;
<sync start=328243>
<p class=KRCC>But believe me, that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
<sync start=332339>&nbsp;
<sync start=333449>
<p class=KRCC>Oh, seriously?
<sync start=335041>&nbsp;
<sync start=335250>
<p class=KRCC>I think his exact words were..
<sync start=337548>&nbsp;
<sync start=340255>
<p class=KRCC>Charming.
<sync start=341244>&nbsp;
<sync start=342124>
<p class=KRCC>He's just a backup.
<sync start=344092>&nbsp;
<sync start=352334>
<p class=KRCC>-Hey, Monica. 
<sync start=356031>&nbsp;
<sync start=352334>
<p class=KRCC>Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
<sync start=356031>&nbsp;
<sync start=357506>
<p class=KRCC>-It's for my boat. Pretty cool, huh? 
<sync start=361340>&nbsp;
<sync start=357506>
<p class=KRCC>Yeah, it's great.
<sync start=361340>&nbsp;
<sync start=361543>
<p class=KRCC>What's wrong? Talk to the captain.
<sync start=364068>&nbsp;
<sync start=366048>
<p class=KRCC>Just realizing I'm in a dead-end relationship.
<sync start=369484>&nbsp;
<sync start=369685>
<p class=KRCC>-Chandler being difficult? 
<sync start=373587>&nbsp;
<sync start=369685>
<p class=KRCC>I don't want marriage tomorrow.
<sync start=373587>&nbsp;
<sync start=373789>
<p class=KRCC>But I wanna know we're going somewhere, that I'm not wasting time.
<sync start=378249>&nbsp;
<sync start=378427>
<p class=KRCC>-You know Chandler. 
<sync start=381487>&nbsp;
<sync start=378427>
<p class=KRCC>No, I don't know Chandler.
<sync start=381487>&nbsp;
<sync start=381697>
<p class=KRCC>Not anymore. It's like something's changed.
<sync start=385929>&nbsp;
<sync start=386301>
<p class=KRCC>-Maybe you changed. 
<sync start=389668>&nbsp;
<sync start=386301>
<p class=KRCC>I didn't change.
<sync start=389668>&nbsp;
<sync start=390105>
<p class=KRCC>Maybe that's the problem.
<sync start=391834>&nbsp;
<sync start=393542>
<p class=KRCC>-What? 
<sync start=396409>&nbsp;
<sync start=393542>
<p class=KRCC>Chandler is a complex fellow.
<sync start=396409>&nbsp;
<sync start=396612>
<p class=KRCC>One who is unlikely to take a wife.
<sync start=399308>&nbsp;
<sync start=402792>
<p class=KRCC>Does he think I'll wait around for nothing?
<sync start=405955>&nbsp;
<sync start=406162>
<p class=KRCC>Face it. Chandler is against marriage.
<sync start=409325>&nbsp;
<sync start=409532>
<p class=KRCC>And always will be.
<sync start=411397>&nbsp;
<sync start=412635>
<p class=KRCC>There's some people who do wanna marry me.
<sync start=415536>&nbsp;
<sync start=415738>
<p class=KRCC>-There are? 
<sync start=418036>&nbsp;
<sync start=415738>
<p class=KRCC>Yeah. Richard.
<sync start=418036>&nbsp;
<sync start=418541>
<p class=KRCC>Richard said he wants to marry you?
<sync start=421408>&nbsp;
<sync start=422111>
<p class=KRCC>-And Chandler says he hates marriage? 
<sync start=425911>&nbsp;
<sync start=422111>
<p class=KRCC>That's right.
<sync start=425911>&nbsp;
<sync start=426115>
<p class=KRCC>Chandler loves marriage!
<sync start=427980>&nbsp;
<sync start=430153>
<p class=KRCC>You just said he hates marriage!
<sync start=432383>&nbsp;
<sync start=432588>
<p class=KRCC>"He's a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife"!
<sync start=436149>&nbsp;
<sync start=436359>
<p class=KRCC>"He's against marriage and always will be"!
<sync start=438000>&nbsp;
<sync start=439022>
<p class=KRCC>You got that from what I said?
<sync start=441000>&nbsp;
<sync start=448584>
<p class=KRCC>-Rach. 
<sync start=451018>&nbsp;
<sync start=448584>
<p class=KRCC>Hey, you.
<sync start=451018>&nbsp;
<sync start=452655>
<p class=KRCC>-Come on in. 
<sync start=454282>&nbsp;
<sync start=452655>
<p class=KRCC>Thank you.
<sync start=454282>&nbsp;
<sync start=454257>
<p class=KRCC>I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
<sync start=457317>&nbsp;
<sync start=457527>
<p class=KRCC>Thanks. I really thought we'd be able to make it work.
<sync start=461623>&nbsp;
<sync start=461831>
<p class=KRCC>I guess it wasn't meant to be.
<sync start=463992>&nbsp;
<sync start=464200>
<p class=KRCC>Yeah. Love. It's a tricky business, isn't it?
<sync start=468603>&nbsp;
<sync start=470006>
<p class=KRCC>-I guess so. 
<sync start=473669>&nbsp;
<sync start=470006>
<p class=KRCC>So, what do you say we make a pact?
<sync start=473669>&nbsp;
<sync start=473877>
<p class=KRCC>If you and I are both single by 40, we get married.
<sync start=477335>&nbsp;
<sync start=477547>
<p class=KRCC>I mean, we know each other, we like each other...
<sync start=480744>&nbsp;
<sync start=480950>
<p class=KRCC>we've already slept together, so there'll be no surprises.
<sync start=484977>&nbsp;
<sync start=485188>
<p class=KRCC>No, like, "What's that?"
<sync start=486917>&nbsp;
<sync start=490360>
<p class=KRCC>-Oh, you want me to be your backup. 
<sync start=494490>&nbsp;
<sync start=490360>
<p class=KRCC>Exactly.
<sync start=494490>&nbsp;
<sync start=494697>
<p class=KRCC>Yeah. I already have one.
<sync start=496824>&nbsp;
<sync start=498167>
<p class=KRCC>-What? Who? 
<sync start=499657>&nbsp;
<sync start=498167>
<p class=KRCC>Phoebe.
<sync start=499657>&nbsp;
<sync start=499869>
<p class=KRCC>Phoebe?
<sync start=501393>&nbsp;
<sync start=501905>
<p class=KRCC>But she just said Joey is her backup.
<sync start=504772>&nbsp;
<sync start=504974>
<p class=KRCC>Oh, I don't think so.
<sync start=507135>&nbsp;
<sync start=507844>
<p class=KRCC>I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal.
<sync start=511837>&nbsp;
<sync start=512048>
<p class=KRCC>That's impossible. We have had a deal for years. We shook on it.
<sync start=516485>&nbsp;
<sync start=516686>
<p class=KRCC>Although, believe me, she wanted to do a lot more than that.
<sync start=520884>&nbsp;
<sync start=524036>
<p class=KRCC>Where the hell have you been?!
<sync start=526334>&nbsp;
<sync start=526538>
<p class=KRCC>I was making a coconut phone with the Professor.
<sync start=530167>&nbsp;
<sync start=531310>
<p class=KRCC>Richard told Monica he wants to marry her.
<sync start=534507>&nbsp;
<sync start=534680>
<p class=KRCC>-What? 
<sync start=538309>&nbsp;
<sync start=534680>
<p class=KRCC>I've been trying to find you.
<sync start=538309>&nbsp;
<sync start=538517>
<p class=KRCC>And I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
<sync start=543079>&nbsp;
<sync start=543288>
<p class=KRCC>-Oh, my God! 
<sync start=545779>&nbsp;
<sync start=543288>
<p class=KRCC>I know! They suck!
<sync start=545779>&nbsp;
<sync start=545991>
<p class=KRCC>He's not supposed to ask her to marry him! I am!
<sync start=549256>&nbsp;
<sync start=549461>
<p class=KRCC>-I know! 
<sync start=550758>&nbsp;
<sync start=549461>
<p class=KRCC>What..?
<sync start=550758>&nbsp;
<sync start=550963>
<p class=KRCC>You know what I'll do? I'll go over there and kick his ass!
<sync start=555059>&nbsp;
<sync start=555267>
<p class=KRCC>Will you help me?
<sync start=556632>&nbsp;
<sync start=558370>
<p class=KRCC>Look, I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution, okay?
<sync start=563535>&nbsp;
<sync start=563742>
<p class=KRCC>-Look, just go and find Monica. 
<sync start=567178>&nbsp;
<sync start=563742>
<p class=KRCC>You're right.
<sync start=567178>&nbsp;
<sync start=567379>
<p class=KRCC>Okay. I'm gonna get the ring...
<sync start=569745>&nbsp;
<sync start=569948>
<p class=KRCC>I'm gonna go find her and I'm gonna propose!
<sync start=573042>&nbsp;
<sync start=574519>
<p class=KRCC>Dude! Dude! Dude!
<sync start=576043>&nbsp;
<sync start=576221>
<p class=KRCC>That coconut phone might be good for the boat.
<sync start=579588>&nbsp;
<sync start=594172>
<p class=KRCC>Hi.
<sync start=599273>&nbsp;
<sync start=602947>
<p class=KRCC>I don't know why I'm here.
<sync start=604812>&nbsp;
<sync start=605449>
<p class=KRCC>I didn't ask.
<sync start=607041>&nbsp;
<sync start=609453>
<p class=KRCC>-You wanna come in? 
<sync start=612718>&nbsp;
<sync start=609453>
<p class=KRCC>I don't know.
<sync start=612718>&nbsp;
<sync start=613491>
<p class=KRCC>Oh, okay.
<sync start=615220>&nbsp;
<sync start=615860>
<p class=KRCC>I'll just leave the door open and sit on the couch.
<sync start=619523>&nbsp;
<sync start=621499>
<p class=KRCC>-Chandler is such an idiot! 
<sync start=624866>&nbsp;
<sync start=621499>
<p class=KRCC>Drink?
<sync start=624866>&nbsp;
<sync start=626137>
<p class=KRCC>-Scotch on the.. 
<sync start=629163>&nbsp;
<sync start=626137>
<p class=KRCC>Rocks with a twist?
<sync start=629163>&nbsp;
<sync start=629373>
<p class=KRCC>I remember.
<sync start=630897>&nbsp;
<sync start=633744>
<p class=KRCC>You still smoking cigars?
<sync start=635871>&nbsp;
<sync start=636747>
<p class=KRCC>No, no. That's art.
<sync start=639215>&nbsp;
<sync start=640918>
<p class=KRCC>If it bothers you, I can put my art out.
<sync start=643944>&nbsp;
<sync start=644688>
<p class=KRCC>No, that's okay.
<sync start=646656>&nbsp;
<sync start=649026>
<p class=KRCC>So, Monica, let me ask you a question.
<sync start=652655>&nbsp;
<sync start=652863>
<p class=KRCC>Since we broke up, do you ever...
<sync start=655798>&nbsp;
<sync start=656000>
<p class=KRCC>think about me?
<sync start=657627>&nbsp;
<sync start=658402>
<p class=KRCC>Actually, I thought about you a few months ago.
<sync start=661462>&nbsp;
<sync start=661639>
<p class=KRCC>-Really? 
<sync start=663607>&nbsp;
<sync start=661639>
<p class=KRCC>But it's because...
<sync start=663607>&nbsp;
<sync start=663808>
<p class=KRCC>I had an eye exam, and I don't like my new eye doctor.
<sync start=667539>&nbsp;
<sync start=668679>
<p class=KRCC>-Who is it? 
<sync start=670306>&nbsp;
<sync start=668679>
<p class=KRCC>Edward Nevsky.
<sync start=670306>&nbsp;
<sync start=670648>
<p class=KRCC>He's no good.
<sync start=671945>&nbsp;
<sync start=674018>
<p class=KRCC>Do you ever think about me...
<sync start=677181>&nbsp;
<sync start=678022>
<p class=KRCC>-in a non-eye-doctor way? 
<sync start=681116>&nbsp;
<sync start=678022>
<p class=KRCC>No.
<sync start=681116>&nbsp;
<sync start=685429>
<p class=KRCC>Because getting over you was the hardest thing I've ever done.
<sync start=689661>&nbsp;
<sync start=690134>
<p class=KRCC>I never let myself think about you.
<sync start=693001>&nbsp;
<sync start=693537>
<p class=KRCC>Wow.
<sync start=695095>&nbsp;
<sync start=700077>
<p class=KRCC>Phoebe, you picked Joey and Ross?
<sync start=703012>&nbsp;
<sync start=703214>
<p class=KRCC>-You can't have two backups! 
<sync start=707048>&nbsp;
<sync start=703214>
<p class=KRCC>Of course I can.
<sync start=707048>&nbsp;
<sync start=707251>
<p class=KRCC>It's good sense to back up your backup.
<sync start=710118>&nbsp;
<sync start=710321>
<p class=KRCC>-Look, I've already lost Chandler. 
<sync start=712949>&nbsp;
<sync start=710321>
<p class=KRCC>What?
<sync start=712949>&nbsp;
<sync start=713858>
<p class=KRCC>Hey, Phoebe! We're both your backup?
<sync start=716622>&nbsp;
<sync start=716827>
<p class=KRCC>How could you do this to me?
<sync start=719523>&nbsp;
<sync start=720030>
<p class=KRCC>Why are you complaining? You were both aware of the situation.
<sync start=724433>&nbsp;
<sync start=724602>
<p class=KRCC>-I was not! 
<sync start=726536>&nbsp;
<sync start=724602>
<p class=KRCC>No, we weren't!
<sync start=726536>&nbsp;
<sync start=726737>
<p class=KRCC>This kind of backtalk won't fly when we're married.
<sync start=730366>&nbsp;
<sync start=731208>
<p class=KRCC>You can't have both. Pick one.
<sync start=733574>&nbsp;
<sync start=733777>
<p class=KRCC>-Pick me! 
<sync start=735301>&nbsp;
<sync start=733777>
<p class=KRCC>No, pick me!
<sync start=735301>&nbsp;
<sync start=735513>
<p class=KRCC>-I don't wanna end up an old maid. 
<sync start=740473>&nbsp;
<sync start=735513>
<p class=KRCC>All right. Well, let's see.
<sync start=740473>&nbsp;
<sync start=740684>
<p class=KRCC>Ross is a good father.
<sync start=743016>&nbsp;
<sync start=743454>
<p class=KRCC>But...
<sync start=744546>&nbsp;
<sync start=744755>
<p class=KRCC>Joey has a boat. This is hard.
<sync start=747087>&nbsp;
<sync start=747291>
<p class=KRCC>This is crazy. I wanna switch to Rachel.
<sync start=750021>&nbsp;
<sync start=750294>
<p class=KRCC>-I wanna switch to Rachel too. 
<sync start=753889>&nbsp;
<sync start=750294>
<p class=KRCC>No, wait. Just wait.
<sync start=753889>&nbsp;
<sync start=754064>
<p class=KRCC>Wait, guys. Don't make any rash decisions.
<sync start=757227>&nbsp;
<sync start=757434>
<p class=KRCC>Just remember my promise:
<sync start=759425>&nbsp;
<sync start=759637>
<p class=KRCC>If we get married, three times a week.
<sync start=762663>&nbsp;
<sync start=762873>
<p class=KRCC>Oh, my God. Phoebe...
<sync start=764431>&nbsp;
<sync start=764642>
<p class=KRCC>I'm talking about massages.
<sync start=767076>&nbsp;
<sync start=767311>
<p class=KRCC>No, I'm not.
<sync start=769438>&nbsp;
<sync start=772550>
<p class=KRCC>I know how to settle it. We'll do this.
<sync start=775519>&nbsp;
<sync start=775719>
<p class=KRCC>I'm gonna write "Joey" on one napkin...
<sync start=779211>&nbsp;
<sync start=779423>
<p class=KRCC>and "Ross" on the other napkin and we're gonna pick one.
<sync start=784224>&nbsp;
<sync start=784428>
<p class=KRCC>That person will be our backup. Okay?
<sync start=787226>&nbsp;
<sync start=787431>
<p class=KRCC>-Sounds fair. 
<sync start=789023>&nbsp;
<sync start=787431>
<p class=KRCC>All right.
<sync start=789023>&nbsp;
<sync start=789233>
<p class=KRCC>Good. Switching them up.
<sync start=791531>&nbsp;
<sync start=795005>
<p class=KRCC>-Pick one. 
<sync start=796870>&nbsp;
<sync start=795005>
<p class=KRCC>Left.
<sync start=796870>&nbsp;
<sync start=797708>
<p class=KRCC>-Thank you. 
<sync start=799835>&nbsp;
<sync start=797708>
<p class=KRCC>You're welcome.
<sync start=799835>&nbsp;
<sync start=802046>
<p class=KRCC>-Ross. 
<sync start=804514>&nbsp;
<sync start=802046>
<p class=KRCC>Joey.
<sync start=804514>&nbsp;
<sync start=806550>
<p class=KRCC>-We should switch. 
<sync start=808814>&nbsp;
<sync start=806550>
<p class=KRCC>Absolutely.
<sync start=808814>&nbsp;
<sync start=812637>
<p class=KRCC>I missed this apartment. Now, this is a grownup's apartment.
<sync start=817074>&nbsp;
<sync start=817275>
<p class=KRCC>I should be with a grownup, you know?
<sync start=819766>&nbsp;
<sync start=820112>
<p class=KRCC>You're saying you need to be with someone more mature.
<sync start=824276>&nbsp;
<sync start=824950>
<p class=KRCC>Maybe someone with...
<sync start=827077>&nbsp;
<sync start=827486>
<p class=KRCC>a license to practice medicine.
<sync start=830114>&nbsp;
<sync start=830455>
<p class=KRCC>Or a mustache.
<sync start=832218>&nbsp;
<sync start=833525>
<p class=KRCC>Let's face it. I'm not a kid anymore.
<sync start=836187>&nbsp;
<sync start=836394>
<p class=KRCC>I need someone who wants the same things.
<sync start=839329>&nbsp;
<sync start=839531>
<p class=KRCC>Coming to my work and telling me you love me, I want that!
<sync start=843991>&nbsp;
<sync start=844536>
<p class=KRCC>Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
<sync start=848336>&nbsp;
<sync start=849574>
<p class=KRCC>I think that's fair.
<sync start=851201>&nbsp;
<sync start=851409>
<p class=KRCC>Please, don't even talk to me about fair.
<sync start=854344>&nbsp;
<sync start=854546>
<p class=KRCC>Fair would've been you wanting to marry me then.
<sync start=857913>&nbsp;
<sync start=858116>
<p class=KRCC>Or Chandler wanting to marry me now.
<sync start=860584>&nbsp;
<sync start=860786>
<p class=KRCC>Believe me, nothing about this is fair. Nothing.
<sync start=863949>&nbsp;
<sync start=864122>
<p class=KRCC>-Nothing! Nothing! 
<sync start=866852>&nbsp;
<sync start=864122>
<p class=KRCC>It's okay.
<sync start=866852>&nbsp;
<sync start=871329>
<p class=KRCC>Nothing.
<sync start=872728>&nbsp;
<sync start=877669>
<p class=KRCC>I don't know.
<sync start=880697>&nbsp;
<sync start=882474>
<p class=KRCC>I know.
<sync start=883805>&nbsp;
<sync start=887345>
<p class=KRCC>I have to figure some..
<sync start=889711>&nbsp;
<sync start=889915>
<p class=KRCC>Some stuff, before I can...
<sync start=892577>&nbsp;
<sync start=892851>
<p class=KRCC>I understand.
<sync start=894318>&nbsp;
<sync start=895520>
<p class=KRCC>Take as much time as you want.
<sync start=897852>&nbsp;
<sync start=898590>
<p class=KRCC>Ten, even 20 minutes, if you need it.
<sync start=901388>&nbsp;
<sync start=902327>
<p class=KRCC>I'll be here. Not smoking.
<sync start=905091>&nbsp;
<sync start=921880>
<p class=KRCC>Where is she?
<sync start=923370>&nbsp;
<sync start=923615>
<p class=KRCC>I'm not scared of you.
<sync start=925583>&nbsp;
<sync start=927352>
<p class=KRCC>She's not here. And please come in.
<sync start=930082>&nbsp;
<sync start=931356>
<p class=KRCC>Scotch on the rocks...
<sync start=932789>&nbsp;
<sync start=932991>
<p class=KRCC>with a twist, on a coaster.
<sync start=935459>&nbsp;
<sync start=935660>
<p class=KRCC>Monica?
<sync start=937218>&nbsp;
<sync start=938997>
<p class=KRCC>Okay, she was here. But she left.
<sync start=941431>&nbsp;
<sync start=941600>
<p class=KRCC>Where did she go?
<sync start=942999>&nbsp;
<sync start=943201>
<p class=KRCC>She said she had to think things over.
<sync start=945829>&nbsp;
<sync start=946037>
<p class=KRCC>Oh, my God. I can't believe this. I thought you were a good guy.
<sync start=950440>&nbsp;
<sync start=950642>
<p class=KRCC>Look, nothing happened.
<sync start=952405>&nbsp;
<sync start=952611>
<p class=KRCC>Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend you love her?
<sync start=956604>&nbsp;
<sync start=956948>
<p class=KRCC>Well, all right, one thing happened.
<sync start=959576>&nbsp;
<sync start=959951>
<p class=KRCC>You know what you did? My girlfriend is thinking things over.
<sync start=964251>&nbsp;
<sync start=964456>
<p class=KRCC>You made my girlfriend think!
<sync start=967050>&nbsp;
<sync start=968126>
<p class=KRCC>Well, I'm sorry.
<sync start=969889>&nbsp;
<sync start=971062>
<p class=KRCC>-What's to think about? I love her. 
<sync start=973895>&nbsp;
<sync start=971062>
<p class=KRCC>Well...
<sync start=973895>&nbsp;
<sync start=974099>
<p class=KRCC>I'm willing to offer her things that you aren't.
<sync start=977398>&nbsp;
<sync start=977602>
<p class=KRCC>I'm willing to offer her those things. I had a plan...
<sync start=981094>&nbsp;
<sync start=981306>
<p class=KRCC>to throw her off so when I offered all these things, she'd be surprised.
<sync start=986642>&nbsp;
<sync start=986945>
<p class=KRCC>If it helps, it worked very well.
<sync start=990005>&nbsp;
<sync start=990849>
<p class=KRCC>It was working till you showed up, you big tree.
<sync start=994250>&nbsp;
<sync start=996721>
<p class=KRCC>This isn't fair.
<sync start=998655>&nbsp;
<sync start=998857>
<p class=KRCC>You had your chance with her, and you blew it!
<sync start=1002190>&nbsp;
<sync start=1002394>
<p class=KRCC>This is my chance. I won't blow it, because we are meant for each other.
<sync start=1007331>&nbsp;
<sync start=1007532>
<p class=KRCC>And this has all just been one stupid mistake!
<sync start=1010831>&nbsp;
<sync start=1011403>
<p class=KRCC>I was gonna propose tonight.
<sync start=1013701>&nbsp;
<sync start=1016641>
<p class=KRCC>-You were gonna propose? 
<sync start=1020270>&nbsp;
<sync start=1016641>
<p class=KRCC>Yeah, I even...
<sync start=1020270>&nbsp;
<sync start=1021346>
<p class=KRCC>got a ring. Did you get a ring?
<sync start=1024611>&nbsp;
<sync start=1024816>
<p class=KRCC>No, I don't have a ring.
<sync start=1026477>&nbsp;
<sync start=1032190>
<p class=KRCC>You go get her, Chandler.
<sync start=1034215>&nbsp;
<sync start=1036828>
<p class=KRCC>And can I give you a piece of advice?
<sync start=1039388>&nbsp;
<sync start=1039597>
<p class=KRCC>If you do get her...
<sync start=1041462>&nbsp;
<sync start=1042534>
<p class=KRCC>don't let her go.
<sync start=1044195>&nbsp;
<sync start=1044369>
<p class=KRCC>Trust me.
<sync start=1045836>&nbsp;
<sync start=1048773>
<p class=KRCC>You know, Richard, you are a good guy.
<sync start=1052265>&nbsp;
<sync start=1054612>
<p class=KRCC>I know.
<sync start=1055772>&nbsp;
<sync start=1057048>
<p class=KRCC>I hate that.
<sync start=1058572>&nbsp;
<sync start=1073064>
<p class=KRCC>-I've gotta find Monica. 
<sync start=1075658>&nbsp;
<sync start=1073064>
<p class=KRCC>She's gone.
<sync start=1075658>&nbsp;
<sync start=1076034>
<p class=KRCC>-What? 
<sync start=1079470>&nbsp;
<sync start=1076034>
<p class=KRCC>She had a bag and she left.
<sync start=1079470>&nbsp;
<sync start=1079671>
<p class=KRCC>-What? 
<sync start=1081639>&nbsp;
<sync start=1079671>
<p class=KRCC>She was all crying...
<sync start=1081639>&nbsp;
<sync start=1081840>
<p class=KRCC>She said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think."
<sync start=1085173>&nbsp;
<sync start=1085377>
<p class=KRCC>-Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan? 
<sync start=1089609>&nbsp;
<sync start=1085377>
<p class=KRCC>I told her everything.
<sync start=1089609>&nbsp;
<sync start=1089814>
<p class=KRCC>-But she wouldn't believe me. 
<sync start=1094080>&nbsp;
<sync start=1089814>
<p class=KRCC>Well, where..? Where did she go?
<sync start=1094080>&nbsp;
<sync start=1094285>
<p class=KRCC>To her parents'. She said you shouldn't call. But if I were you, I would.
<sync start=1099655>&nbsp;
<sync start=1100191>
<p class=KRCC>-I can't believe I ruined this. 
<sync start=1104423>&nbsp;
<sync start=1100191>
<p class=KRCC>I am so sorry, man.
<sync start=1104423>&nbsp;
<sync start=1115607>
<p class=KRCC>You wanted it to be a surprise.
<sync start=1118132>&nbsp;
<sync start=1128053>
<p class=KRCC>Oh, my God.
<sync start=1129543>&nbsp;
<sync start=1136094>
<p class=KRCC>Chandler...
<sync start=1137584>&nbsp;
<sync start=1138930>
<p class=KRCC>in all my life...
<sync start=1140898>&nbsp;
<sync start=1141633>
<p class=KRCC>I never thought I would be so lucky...
<sync start=1144295>&nbsp;
<sync start=1147872>
<p class=KRCC>as to fall in love with my best...
<sync start=1151467>&nbsp;
<sync start=1152877>
<p class=KRCC>My best...
<sync start=1154469>&nbsp;
<sync start=1155547>
<p class=KRCC>There's a reason why girls don't do this!
<sync start=1158482>&nbsp;
<sync start=1159417>
<p class=KRCC>I'll do it. I thought...
<sync start=1161977>&nbsp;
<sync start=1166424>
<p class=KRCC>Wait, I can do this.
<sync start=1168051>&nbsp;
<sync start=1171996>
<p class=KRCC>I thought that it mattered...
<sync start=1175022>&nbsp;
<sync start=1175233>
<p class=KRCC>what I said or where I said it.
<sync start=1178828>&nbsp;
<sync start=1179537>
<p class=KRCC>Then I realized...
<sync start=1181562>&nbsp;
<sync start=1181906>
<p class=KRCC>the only thing that matters is that you...
<sync start=1184807>&nbsp;
<sync start=1188713>
<p class=KRCC>You make me happier than I ever thought I could be.
<sync start=1193082>&nbsp;
<sync start=1196221>
<p class=KRCC>And if you let me...
<sync start=1198121>&nbsp;
<sync start=1198723>
<p class=KRCC>I'll spend all my life trying to make you feel the same way.
<sync start=1203092>&nbsp;
<sync start=1212003>
<p class=KRCC>Monica...
<sync start=1213402>&nbsp;
<sync start=1215440>
<p class=KRCC>will you marry me?
<sync start=1216907>&nbsp;
<sync start=1219144>
<p class=KRCC>Yes.
<sync start=1220668>&nbsp;
<sync start=1234626>
<p class=KRCC>I knew you were likely to take a wife!
<sync start=1237857>&nbsp;
<sync start=1239864>
<p class=KRCC>Can we come in yet? We're dying out here!
<sync start=1243027>&nbsp;
<sync start=1243635>
<p class=KRCC>Come in! Come in!
<sync start=1245159>&nbsp;
<sync start=1247272>
<p class=KRCC>We're engaged!
<sync start=1249103>&nbsp;
<sync start=1255780>
<p class=KRCC>This is the least jealous I've ever been.
<sync start=1258715>&nbsp;
<sync start=1259350>
<p class=KRCC>Oh, no, wait! This is wrong! Ross isn't here!
<sync start=1262581>&nbsp;
<sync start=1264589>
<p class=KRCC>Hell, he's done it three times. He knows what it's about!
<sync start=1268650>&nbsp;
